# Human Pose Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements human pose detection using machine learning techniques. It leverages deep learning models such as OpenPose, PoseNet, or MediaPipe to estimate human joint positions from images or video streams.

## Features
- Detect human body keypoints in real-time
- Support for single-person and multi-person pose estimation
- Works with images, videos, and live webcam streams
- Pretrained deep learning models for high accuracy
- Export pose data for further analysis

## Requirements
### Hardware:
- GPU (recommended for faster inference)
- Webcam (for live detection)

### Software:
- Python 3.12
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- MediaPipe / OpenPose / PoseNet
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jvssankar/Human-pose-detection-using-ML.git
   cd human-pose-detection
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt

## Output:
- Detected keypoints plotted on the image/video
